Hi Ikonic,


#. The backend code is in the repository named as ikonic-coding-backend and the frontend code which is built in vuejs will be added to the email becuase the file size is greater then  25 MB which github doesn't allow. 

#. I have used the repository design pattern in the backend for laravel which i was asked in the interview and i didn't know. 

#. Also the fontend contains three routes named as login,register and suggestion. The suggestion route contain the task but the data is not dynamic and thats the main point i am writing this file. The reason to that was an error which i got named as cors error becuase i was using my mac and was running both projects on same server due to less resources (my only mac). i tried very hard to overcome the error by adding the baryved and fruitcake cors packages but it didn't work and it took my whole day. But i have created  api's for login and registration in which  i am using vuex store and managing methods there. i just wanted to show you that i know how to do it but the cors error. 

#. Last but not the least. I enjoyed the hiring process and i learned alot from the task that how to use design patterns and use conventions and thats the best part for myself in this whole process.

Thank You IKONIC , for giving me the opportunity.
